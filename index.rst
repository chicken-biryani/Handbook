FLINT Handbook
==============

"There is nothing permanent except change. - Heraclitus ". 

We are trained to expect or welcome change, but what should we do if those changes result in unfavourable or unfavorable circumstances? Climate change is a prime illustration of such a change.

Long-term changes in temperature and weather patterns are referred to as climate change. Although these changes may be natural, since the 1800s, human actions like the combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation have been the primary contributors to climate change. Solar variation, volcanic activity, and other factors are some other natural sources of climate change.

Greenhouse gases that wrap the globe are released as a result of land usage related to agriculture, forestry, and human growth. More focus has been placed on reducing the effects of human-induced climate change, which includes hotter temperatures, more intense storms, increasing drought, rising sea levels, and increased health hazards. This brings us to FLINT.

The Full Lands Integration Tool (FLINT) is a moja global software used for measuring, reporting, and verifying (MRV) greenhouse gas emissions and removals from forestry, agriculture, and other land uses (AFOLU).

Consistent with the guidelines by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), FLINT utilises multiple data streams to forecast future greenhouse gas emissions and removals.


**What is included in this handbook.**

Understanding climate science, the issues climate change poses to our environment, and the actions we can take to lessen its effects are all covered in the FLINT handbook.

Expanding on FLINT, this handbook seeks to highlight FLINT modules, inputs and expected outputs from the tool. We discuss using carbon models like the Generic Carbon Budget Model (GCBM) to assess the natural and anthropogenic effects of disturbances like wildfire, oil and gas explorations, etc., on our forest's landscape.

Finally, we discuss what the future holds for the world in which we live, the effects of rising carbon dioxide on our forests, and—most importantly—how we expect our planet to change.
